# TODO

> **Purpose**: Active task tracker linked to GitHub Issues. Each entry mirrors an open issue with its acceptance criteria.
>
> **Rules**:
>
> - Every entry MUST link to a GitHub Issue (`#number`). No unlinked items.
> - Entries are auto-removed by the `todo-sync` workflow when the linked issue is closed.
> - Agents MAY add entries during self-reflection (Step 1) — create the issue first, then add it here.
> - Format: `<!-- todo:NUMBER -->` marker, issue link, status, then indented acceptance criteria.
