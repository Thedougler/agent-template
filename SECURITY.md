## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue.
2. Email the maintainer or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
3. Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a fix or mitigation plan within 7 days.
